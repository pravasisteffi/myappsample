Sunday is my favorite day because I spend the day watching football with my dad.On Sunday,
unlike the other days of the week when he works, my dad spends the whole day with me watching
football on TV. We even eat lunch together while watching. The highlight of the day is watching the
Dolphins game. Dad and I get so excited, we yell and cheer together.On Sundays, I get to combine 
watching my favorite sport and spending time with my favorite personâ€”what a great day!
